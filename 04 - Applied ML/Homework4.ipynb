    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will apply [propensity score matching](http://www.stewartschultz.com/statistics/books/Design%20of%20observational%20studies.pdf), which we discussed in lecture 5 (\"Observational studies\"), in order to draw conclusions from an observational study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with a by-now classic dataset from Robert LaLonde's study \"[Evaluating the Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs](http://people.hbs.edu/nashraf/LaLonde_1986.pdf)\" (1986).\n",
    "The study investigated the effect of a job training program (\"National Supported Work Demonstration\") on the real earnings of an individual, a couple of years after completion of the program.\n",
    "Your task is to determine the effectiveness of the \"treatment\" represented by the job training program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "- `treat`: 1 if the subject participated in the job training program, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `age`: the subject's age\n",
    "- `educ`: years of education\n",
    "- `race`: categorical variable with three possible values: Black, Hispanic, or White\n",
    "- `married`: 1 if the subject was married at the time of the training program, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `nodegree`: 1 if the subject has earned no school degree, 0 otherwise\n",
    "- `re74`: real earnings in 1974 (pre-treatment)\n",
    "- `re75`: real earnings in 1975 (pre-treatment)\n",
    "- `re78`: real earnings in 1978 (outcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to brush up your knowledge on propensity scores and observational studies, we highly recommend Rosenbaum's excellent book on the [\"Design of Observational Studies\"](http://www.stewartschultz.com/statistics/books/Design%20of%20observational%20studies.pdf).

    "We decided to keep the number of estimators constant, and run the grid search only on the maximum depth. As a rule of thumb, the number of estimators in a random forest should be set to a high value (e.g. 100 to 1000) and be no longer touched, since it can only improve the result. As described by the original authors of the algorithm, [\"you can run as many trees as you want\"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#remarks). Many researchers claim that 100 to 300 estimators (i.e. trees) are more than enough for almost all cases. As a result, the choice of this hyperparameter is just a trade-off between training time and accuracy, given that after a certain threshold the accuracy no longer improves.\n",

Random forest use *bagging*, which means that the final result is the average of the outcomes of many simple models. If a low number of trees is used, the result will tend to fluctuate due to the high variance (and this could even compromise the validation result), whereas with many trees the result will be more consistent. This can be observed by running a k-fold cross validation (which is not done here): the higher the number of trees is, the lower the standard deviation of the error/accuracy will be.\n",

In our case, each feature corresponds to a word, as returned by ```TfidfVectorizer```. Similarly, we can convert a feature back to a textual word by using the inverse map.\n",

The solution is to build a [one-vs-rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification#One-vs.-rest) model, that is, for each label $k$ we train a model where $y_i=1$ if $y_i==k$ and $0$ otherwise.
