    "Buying from huge e-commerce websites such as Amazon has many advantages, but, paradoxically, users are often confused by the wide variety of products.\n",
    "They may have a rough idea about the characteristics of the product they want to buy (e.g. a high-end smartphone), and they often undergo the same process of comparing similar products. We want to understand why clients tend to choose a product over another, i.e. what are the desirable characteristics of a popular product? Hopefully, we would get some insights that could prove useful for both clients and vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon dataset contains relations among products, such as \"also viewed\", \"also bought\", \"bought together\", \"bought after viewing\". These links can be used to create a graph that represents products with similar characteristics, that is, products that are viewed together but not bought together.\n",
    "TODO: change (we look for the best product also outside the cliques). Our idea is to exploit the dataset in order to create clusters of competing products. These clusters may be used not only to identify the best product in terms of rating and sales within a group, but also to investigate how brands can influence the sales and the prices of similar products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is transformed into a graph of relations between products, where the vertices represent products, and edges represent competition between products. For instance, if some people buy product A after viewing product B and vice versa, and the two products are not bought together, they are competitors. On the other hand, two products that are bought together are not competitors (e.g. a user buys a smartphone and a cover). A way of expressing this in more formal terms is with max-cliques, that is, finding sets of vertices that are totally interconnected."

    "Before moving forward, we have to decide whether it makes sense to carry out our analysis on the whole dataset, or if it is more appropriate to select only a subset of all categories. It turns out that the latter is the case: sales in categories such as **Music**, **Books**, or **Clothes** depend on people's personal preferences, and are less (if not at all) prone to competition. On the contrary, electronic products are the ones that are subject to real competition, as clients wants to get the best possible product at the lowest cost. Moreover, this selection step allows us to reduce the size of the dataset and process it more efficiently.\n",

    "Therefore, the first step consists in listing all categories and selecting those in which we are interested. As can be seen from the example above, categories are represented as hierarchies, e.g. `[\"Sports & Outdoors\", \"Other Sports\", \"Dance\"]` means that the product can be found in the category **Sports & Outdoors -> Other Sports -> Dance**. Firstly, we extract the list of macro-categories (top-level categories such as **Sports & Outdoors**) along with their product count, and we inspect them manually. Our goal is to choose macro-categories containing products that can be objectively compared in terms of features and characteristics, such as *Electronics* or *Cell phones*. Converseley, categories of which the purchase decision is subjective (e.g. clothes and books) are discarded."

Earlier, we observed that the distribution of the *number of reviews* feature is heavy-tailed. To illustrate this clearly, we plot it below."

    "Since we need to process big graphs, we decided not to use libraries such as *networkx*. In fact, our early experiments with these libraries turned out to yield unsatisfying performance. As a result, we wrote a small graph library optimized for this kind of sparse, unweighted graphs, and that implements a handful of basic algorithms (max-clique extraction, strongly connected components labeling).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first pre-processing step, we build our graph data structure using an efficient layout: adjacency lists indexed by numbers, and not strings. This representation is suitable because the graph is expected to be sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going into more depth, the graph is constructed as follows:\n",
    "- We add an edge from product A to product B if clients buy B after viewing A (direct competition).\n",
    "- We remove an edge between A and B if A and B are frequently bought together (no competition).\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous experiments, we tried to employ the *also_viewed* relation, with mixed results. This relation produces a graph that is too dense to give meaningful results, which is probably due to the fact that Amazon uses *Collaborative filtering* to produce these recommendations (the details are described [here](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/ic/2017/03/mic2017030012.html) and [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/RG_CartSimilarities.html)), and not actual graph relations."

    "As can be observed above, our mini-library enriches the dataset with new fields. In particular, we can access it in two ways:\n",
    "- Through `g.records`, which returns a list of objects.\n",
    "- Through `g.df`, which returns a pandas `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new fields, which are useful for graph analysis, are:\n",
    "- **fan_in** (also referred to as the in-degree of the node): represents the number of incoming edges on a given node. In our context, it corresponds to the number of other products that lead to the product in exam. As a result, a product with a high fan-in metric is a good one, as people prefer it after viewing many other products.\n",
    "- **fan_out** (also referred to as the out-degree of the node): represents the number of outgoing edges on a given node. A product with a low fan-in and high fan-out is expected to be worse than other products.\n",
    "- **fan_diff**: **fan_in** minus **fan_out**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we extract the strongly connected components of the graph using Kosaraju's algorithm. In this case, we repeat the analysis with two cases: the *directed* case (the graph is kept as-is, with directed edges), and the *undirected* case (the graph is considered as if it were undirected). The latter produces bigger connected components and could be more useful in some cases. The new fields added to the products are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **comp_id_dir**: the label of the connected component to which this node belongs (directed graph).\n",
    "- **comp_size_dir**: the size of the connected component to which this node belongs (directed graph).\n",
    "- **comp_id_undir**: the label of the connected component to which this node belongs (undirected graph).\n",
    "- **comp_size_undir**: the size of the connected component to which this node belongs (undirected graph).\n",

    "### Devising a metric for preferred products\n",
    "For the next steps, we need a reliable metric for determining whether a product is *better* than another. By *better*, we mean a product that is preferred over other products, for reasons that are still unknown to us. Obviously, the **buy after viewing** graph relation allow us to observe this directly. However, within a clique, all products are totally interconnected, and it is impossible to determine the \"winner\" only by looking at the relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We argue that the **fan-in** field (the number of incoming edges) is the best indicator for a preferred product. Other possible metrics (along with their disadvantages) would be:\n",
    "- **Sales Rank:** Amazon provides a ranking for many categories, and the `salesRankPos` represents the position of the product within this ranking. However, this choice presents some disadvantages:\n",
    " - The salesRank field is available only on 60% of products.\n",
    " - The rank evolves over time. For example, a phone that was very popular 10 years ago (and maybe 1st in the ranking) might be at the end of the ranking today. This will obviously render the data very noisy, and for this reason we need a metric that remains (almost) constant over time.\n",
    " - The granularity of categories is too coarse. The ranking is not available for all sub-categories, but only for a couple of them. Many products in the *Electronics* sub-categories refer to the *Electronics* macro-category.\n",
    "- **Average rating:** we believe that this is the worst choice. As observed earlier, people tend to give very high and similar ratings on average, and comparing them tends to produce noisy results.\n",
    "- **Number of reviews:** expectedly, the number of reviews linearly correlates with the number of sales (if we assume that a constant fraction of people review a product). This value could be used for estimating the total number of sales of a product, and thus, its popularity. However, it does not directly indicate whether a product is preferred over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our choice for the **fan-in** is motivated by the fact that it represents the number of times a given product has been preferred over other products, which is different from saying that it sold more or is more popular. Of course, these quantities are related in some way (as we will see in a moment), but they also present fundamental differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we present a correlation analysis on the cliques. Specifically, we convert the numeric indicators of a product (fan-in, average rating, sales rank, number of reviews, and price) to a rank within the clique, and we evaluate the Pearson correlation coefficients between these variables. Using the rank instead of the absolute value provides a more fair comparison."

    "Given two related products (e.g. the products in a cliques or just connected by one edge), we want to predict the preferred one (i.e. the one with the highest fan-in) by analyzing their features (both numeric and textual). Our goal is not to build a predictor, but to analyze what the model learns (interpretation) and gain some insight on how people decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we focus on the *Cell Phones* subcategory, which is a field with strong competition. We do this analysis on **buy after viewing** relations, and not cliques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our interpretation pipeline aims at comparing two products (specifically, *ranking* them). Given the features of two products, we want to feed them to a binary classifier that determines the best of the two. This approach, in the [learning to rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank) context, is referred to as the **pairwise approach**. A good reference for these models can be found [here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.222.6261&rep=rep1&type=pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text analysis\n",
    "The text analysis pipeline works as follows:\n",
    "- Given two products, we extract their textual features from their *titles* using a tf-idf vectorizer. We also tried the description, with similar results. The title represents a more direct description of the product and is easier to interpret.\n",
    "- We subtract the feature vectors of the two products to produce the feature vector to supply to the classifier. As for the ground truth, provided that the subtraction is $A - B$, we put the label 0 if the winner is A, and 1 if the winner is B. For each sample, we also provide the opposite sample ($B - A$ with the inverted label), so that the classifier learns the commutative property and the classes are perfectly balanced.\n",
    "- We train a random forest on our data, with a fixed number of estimators (1000) and an optimal tree depth which is determined by grid search and cross-validation. Specifically, we perform a 5-fold cross-validation and select the depth that yields the best accuracy on the validation set.\n",
    "- We evaluate our model on a small test set (20% of the data) to determine whether it overfitted or not.\n",
    "- We take the most important features learned by the random forest (given by the sorted `clf.feature_importances_`), and we try to interpret them. However, this is not sufficient, as we get only an indication of their magnitude (a positive value), and not whether they affect positively or negatively the result.\n",
    "- To get an idea of their impact, we select the top 1000 features (i.e. words) in terms of importance, and we use them to train a L2-regularized logistic regressor. By analyzing the weights learned by the latter, we can observe the sign of each feature, which corresponds to the impact (negative or positive) of the feature on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this process might seem convoluted, it is the result of many experiments. Initially, we tried to use L1-regularized logistic regression instead of random forests, which is expected to select only a few features (thanks to its sparsity property). Indeed, out of the thousands of features, only a few of them are selected. However, the model tends to overfit some features (e.g. the name of the model of a particular product, such as GT-I9500) in order to maximize the score, and these features are given a huge weight. As a result, it becomes impossible to interpret the model, as the useful features are buried by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, random forests average the results of many weaks predictors, and are less susceptible to this kind of overfitting. Therefore, our idea is to use random forests to perform feature selection, and interpret the useful features using logistic regression."

This means that the same product may have relations with multiple other products, and as such, the same product will be present in multiple training samples. We must avoid this, as it would bias our cross-validation results. Ideally, we should make sure that the products sets in the cross-validation buckets are disjoint, that is, a certain product appears only in *one* bucket. One way to ensure this is to remove all products that have already been seen before, thereby guaranteeing their uniqueness."
