    "The dataset will be transformed into a graph of relations between products, where the vertices represent products, and edges represent competitions between products. For instance, if two products are viewed together (people who viewed product A also viewed product B, and vice versa) but not bought together, they are competitors. On the other hand, two products that are viewed together and bought together are not competitors (e.g. a user buys a smartphone and a cover). A way of expressing this in more formal terms is with max-cliques, that is, finding sets of vertices that are totally interconnected."
