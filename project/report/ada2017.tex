\todo{NB: this abstract is just a pure example}
This project aims to find unobserved patterns and insights within a dataset of products on the Amazon website. To conduct our research, we devised an algorithm that builds a graph of such products, where articles with similar characteristics and features are clustered in an innovative manner. According to our experiments, these clusters are proven more accurate than the standard Amazon category aggregations, which are human-made and therefore prone to errors. In addition, biases in brands and descriptions are emphasised.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\todo[inline]{The introduction should contain: 1 general (and not too technical) description of what we are doing (backgroud, justification), 2 related work and challenges, 3 focus of the project or added value, 4 outline of the report structure}
Buying from huge e-commerce websites such as \emph{Amazon} has many advantages, but paradoxically, users are often confused by the vast variety of products. Users may have a rough idea about the characteristics of the product they want to buy, and they often undergo the same process of comparing similar products. We aim to remove this redundancy and aid them in their purchases, suggesting the best or most popular products that correspond to their search. For instance, comparing smartphones or laptops may be difficult due to the wide price range and the required technical knowledge. \\ 
We also aim to identify patterns in the products. Do brands affect popularity and price of a product? Is it possible to identify the best producs among similar ones? 


\section{Dataset structure}
We have been provided with a dataset of Amazon products, along with their reviews. In particular, the dataset consists of two JSON files: \textit{metadata}, which contains information about the products, and \textit{reviews}, which contains reviews and ratings associated to each product.
\subsection{Metadata}
The file contains information about the products, such as their unique ID, description and price. The size of the file is 9.81 GB (uncompressed, json format).
\todo[inline]{List the field of the dataset?}
\subsection{Reviews}
The file contains reviews and ratings associated with each product, as well as the helpfulness of each review. The size of the file is approximately 87 GB (uncompressed, json format). 
\todo[inline]{List the field of the dataset?}

\section{Implementation details}
The dataset, due to its large size, could be not processed directly using Pandas. The initial data processing was performed using PySpark, both on the cluster (especially for the reviews dataset) and in local. While it may seem inappropriate at first, using Spark in local makes sense for medium-sized datasets (like the metadata one), as it automatically parallelizes jobs using all cores, and spills to disk intermediate results that cannot fit in main memory.
\todo[inline]{add merge of the datasets}
\todo[inline]{Mention the reduced dataset?}

\section{Exploratory data analysis}
\todo[inline]{categories, missing data, feature distribution and correlation}
The analyses have been performed on the 25\% of the \todo{reduced} dataset. This sampled subset is still considerably large, therefore, we can assume that it reflects the true statistics.
\subsection{Missing data}
\todo[inline]{put a picture}
From Picture ..., we can observe that results significantly varies among the dataset fields. ID (\textit{asin}) and categories are always present by definition. In addition, almost all articles have at least one review. On the other hand, \textit{SaleRank} and \textit{Brand} are missing in about 60\% of cases. Other fields are in most cases present in the dataset, with a missing ratio lower than 30\%.
\subsection{Feature distribution}
\todo[inline]{put a picture}
Picture .. shows useful insights on the data.  It can be seen that the average ratings tend to be high. The distribution of the number of reviews for each article is heavy-tailed (the mean is much larger than the median). Most reviews are regarded as helpful (50\% of the articles have an helpfulness percentage greater than 90\%), therefore, it is reasonable to consider them with good confidence.
\subsection{Correlation analysis}
\todo[inline]{put a picture}
We have investigated correlations among price, review rating and sales rank. The analysis has been performed on whole subset dataset, without exterminating the single categories independently. 
From Figure .... the correlation coefficients do not seem to be significant. However, some assumption could be asserted. As the price increases, the ratings tend to have lower variance and higher mean. In other words, more expensive products have on average higher ratings.
As the price increases, the sales rank tends to be lower (i.e. better). Costly products may be regarded as superior by people. 
\todo[inline]{The analysis should be redone in the cliques}
\section{Methodology}
\todo[inline]{This should be the core part of the project. Why have we decided to cluster the products with our algorithm? How do we do it? Explain in details how links are created, and what solutions we have tried. Mention how the algorithm works and its complexity. Validate the result, prove that cliques effectlively represent competitive products }
In order to analyse patterns and gain insights in the dataset, we have devised an algorithm to cluster products with similar characteristics, i.e. \textit{competing products}.
\subsection{Graph product}
The dataset is transformed into a graph of relations between products, where the vertices represent products, and edges represent competitions between products. In details: we add an edge from product A to product B if clients buy B after viewing A (direct competition), and
we remove an edge between A and B if A and B are frequently bought together (no competition). A way of expressing this in more formal terms is with max-cliques, that is, finding sets of vertices that are totally interconnected.
The algorithms that we are going to use (e.g. max-cliques) are NP-Complete, and will surely benefit from a clever splitting of the data.
As a first pre-processing step, we build our graph data structure using an efficient layout: adjacency lists indexed by numbers, and not strings. This representation is suitable because the graph is sparse.
In previous experiments, we tried to employ the also viewed relation, with mixed results. This relation produces a graph that is too dense to give meaningful results. Additionally, we believe that the also viewed relation is generated by Amazon's recommender system according to users' preferences, and does not actually represent a graph relation.

\section{Credits}

This document has been adapted from the instructions for earlier ACL
proceedings, including those for ACL-2012 by Maggie Li and Michael
White, those from ACL-2010 by Jing-Shing Chang and Philipp Koehn,
those for ACL-2008 by Johanna D. Moore, Simone Teufel, James Allan,
and Sadaoki Furui, those for ACL-2005 by Hwee Tou Ng and Kemal
Oflazer, those for ACL-2002 by Eugene Charniak and Dekang Lin, and
earlier ACL and EACL formats. Those versions were written by several
people, including John Chen, Henry S. Thompson and Donald
Walker. Additional elements were taken from the formatting
instructions of the {\em International Joint Conference on Artificial
  Intelligence}.

\section{Introduction}

The following instructions are directed to the ADA students who decided to prepare a report. Authors are
required to provide a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their
reports. It must be maximum 4-page long, excluding references.

\section{General Instructions}

Manuscripts must be in two-column format.  Exceptions to the
two-column format include the title, authors' names and complete
addresses, which must be centered at the top of the first page, and
any full-width figures or tables (see the guidelines in
Subsection~\ref{ssec:first}). {\bf Type single-spaced.}  Start all
pages directly under the top margin. See the guidelines later
regarding formatting the first page.

\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}
\label{sect:pdf}

For the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF files are usually produced from
\LaTeX\ using the \textit{pdflatex} command. If your version of
\LaTeX\ produces Postscript files, you can convert these into PDF
using \textit{ps2pdf} or \textit{dvipdf}. On Windows, you can also use
Adobe Distiller to generate PDF.

Please make sure that your PDF file includes all the necessary fonts
(especially tree diagrams, symbols, and fonts with Asian
characters). When you print or create the PDF file, there is usually
an option in your printer setup to include none, all or just
non-standard fonts.  Please make sure that you select the option of
including ALL the fonts. \textbf{Before sending it, test your PDF by
  printing it from a computer different from the one where it was
  created.} Moreover, some word processors may generate very large PDF
files, where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may
reproduce poorly. In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the
PDF. One way on some systems is to install a driver for a postscript
printer, send your document to the printer specifying ``Output to a
file'', then convert the file to PDF.

It is of utmost importance to specify the \textbf{A4 format} (21 cm
x 29.7 cm) when formatting the report. When working with
{\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\tt -t a4}.

Print-outs of the PDF file on A4 report should be identical to the
hardcopy version.


\subsection{Layout}
\label{ssec:layout}

Format manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner these
instructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on A4
report are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Left and right margins: 2.5 cm
\item Top margin: 2.5 cm
\item Bottom margin: 2.5 cm
\item Column width: 7.7 cm
\item Column height: 24.7 cm
\item Gap between columns: 0.6 cm
\end{itemize}

\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other report size, no exceptions.


\subsection{Fonts}

For reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} font should be
used. In \LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in the preamble. If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer
  Modern Roman} (\LaTeX2e{}'s default).  Note that the latter is about
  10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman font.

\end{table}

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}

Center the title and author's name(s) across both
columns. Do not use footnotes for affiliations. Use the
two-column format only when you begin the abstract.

{\bf Title}: Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in
a 15-point bold font. (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles,
see Table~\ref{font-table}) Long titles should be typed on two lines
without a blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 2.5
cm from the top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the
author's names(s) on the following line. Do not
use only initials for given names (middle initials are allowed). Do
not format surnames in all capitals (e.g., use ``Schlangen'' not
``SCHLANGEN'').  Do not format title and section headings in all
capitals as well except for proper names (such as ``BLEU'') that are
conventionally in all capitals. Start the body of the first page 7.5 cm from the top of the
page.

{\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract at the beginning of the first
column. The width of the abstract text should be smaller than the
width of the columns for the text in the body of the report by about
0.6 cm on each side. Center the word {\bf Abstract} in a 12 point bold
font above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a concise
summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the report. It should
be no longer than 150 words. The abstract text should be in 10 point font.

{\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after
the abstract, observing the two-column format as shown in 
the present document. Do not include page numbers.

{\bf Indent} when starting a new paragraph. Use 11 points for text and 
subsection headings, 12 points for section headings and 15 points for
the title. 

\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the
style shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals. Do not number subsubsections.

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear in parentheses
as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in the text
itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}.  Append lowercase letters
to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat double authors as
in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two
authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as
in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations
as sentence constituents. We suggest that instead of
\begin{quote}
  ``\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
you use
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''
\end{quote}

If you are using the provided \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files, you
can use the command \verb|\newcite| to get ``author (year)'' citations.

\textbf{Please do not use anonymous citations} and do not include
acknowledgements when submitting your reports..

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}. Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the 
{\em Publication Manual of the American 
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}.  Use of full names for
authors rather than initials is preferred.  A list of abbreviations
for common computer science journals can be found in the ACM 
{\em Computing Reviews\/}~\cite{ACM:83}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page and use 9
points text. They may be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the line
separating the footnotes from the text.}

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
report near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 11 point text.
